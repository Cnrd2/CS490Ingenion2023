# Product Vision

Our goal for the upcoming semester is to lay the groundwork for the enhancement of the Total Verification System (TVS) by implementing a MicroBlaze soft CPU, selecting and implementing a real-time operating system within it, establishing Ethernet communication capabilities, and creating an interactive webserver within the operating system which has control over the onboard AXI bus and other peripherals. These improvements will enable efficient control and communication with various peripherals, laying the foundation for future enhancements and ensuring seamless integration of Ethernet functionality into the TVS.
