# Ingeion Telemetry Webserver
## Embry-Riddle 2023 CS490 Senior Design Project

# Product Vision

Our objective for this phase of the Ingenion project is to focus on the software development for enhancing the Total Verification System (TVS), a critical testing tool used by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center for simulating, testing, and verifying satellite hardware components. With the FPGA hardware already developed, our attention shifts to refining and expanding the system's software capabilities.This project will consist of the integration of FreeRTOS, an open-source real-time operating system, on the Xilinx MicroBlaze soft-core CPU implemented on the Artix 7 FPGA. In addition to the FreeRTOS implementation, we will develop an interactive web server hosted on the FPGA. The web server will facilitate connections to external computers using TCP over Ethernet, enabling the system to read and display telemetry data from peripherals including GPIO, SPI, UART, and I2C.
